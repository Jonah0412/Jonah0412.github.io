VIDEO FILES FOR PORTFOLIO

To complete the video backgrounds in the portfolio, you'll need to add the following MP4 files to this directory:

1. design-loop.mp4 - For the Commercial Photography item
   - Recommended: A subtle, professional design or photography workflow loop

2. brand-logo.mp4 - For the Brand Identity item
   - Recommended: A logo animation or branding reveal

3. app-demo.mp4 - For the Fitness App item
   - Recommended: A UI demonstration or app interaction video

Video Requirements:
- Format: MP4 (H.264 codec)
- Duration: 5-10 seconds (will loop automatically)
- Resolution: At least 1280x720px (HD)
- No sound needed (videos are muted)
- Small file size recommended (compress videos to under 5MB each for better performance)

If you don't have custom videos, you can find suitable stock footage from:
- Pexels Videos (free): https://www.pexels.com/videos/
- Pixabay (free): https://pixabay.com/videos/
- Envato Elements (paid): https://elements.envato.com/video-templates

Once added, the videos will automatically load and play in a loop without sound on your portfolio page.
